1) Please ensure that the video files "Night Drive - 2689.mp4", "road.avi" and "challenge_video.mp4" are in the same folder as that of 
the codes.
2) Please download the images that are to be stitched for problem 2 data 1 to the same location as the program 'Video_stitch.py' incase 
you want to check this code. I have provided the stitched video so it is not requied to run 'Video_stitch.py' file.
3) The files "Problem1.py","Problem2.py" and "Problem2_data2.py" are the main program files and "Video_stitch.py" is used to stitch
the images together.
4)1) The project is divied into into 3 programs as follows:
Problem1.py  ----------->  The solution for problem 1
Problem2.py ----------->  The sloution for problem 2 data 1
Problem2_data2.py ----------->  The solution for problem 2 data 2
5) In the file "Problem1.py" you can check both the histogram equalization method i.e. in RGB and HSV. By default the code is set to 
HSV equalization. You can check the RGB equalization by uncommenting the line 129 and commenting the line 130.
